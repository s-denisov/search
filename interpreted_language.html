<h1>Interpreted languages</h1>
Interpreted languages are languages that can be executed immediately (by an <dfn>interpreter</dfn>) without first having to be converted (<dfn>compiled</dfn>) into machine code. Such languages can be easier and faster to program in but can be slower to run and result in missed errors. Examples include <a href="./javascript.html">JavaScript</a> and <a href="./python.html">Python</a>.

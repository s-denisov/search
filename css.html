<h1>CSS</h1>
CSS is a language used in <a href="./front_end_development.html">front-end development</a>. It is used for describing the styling of webpages - for example, the background color of elements. It is used by loading it from an <a href="html.html">HTML</a> file. This can be done in a variety of ways: by adding it to an HTML tag, adding it within a certain tag at the start of an HTML file or by using a certain tag to load it from an external file.
